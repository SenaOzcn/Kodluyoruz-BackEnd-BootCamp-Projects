## Zodiac Animal Program

There are 12 zodiac signs and the order goes like this: Rat, Ox, Tiger, Rabbit, Dragon, Snake, Horse, Goat, Monkey, Rooster, Dog and Pig. The program find your Chinese zodiac animal in Java.

## Leap Years Program

To be a leap year, the year number must be divisible by four – except for end-of-century years, which must be divisible by 400.

## Password Control Program

Customer account login password control with **while** loop.

## Average

Program that calculates the average of numbers divisible by 3 and 4 from numbers 0 to the number entered with Java loops.

## Sum of even Numbers

A program that accepts input from the user until a single number is entered with Java loops and adds even and multiples of 4 from the entered values ​​and prints it on the screen.

## Exponent Calculator

**Power of 4 Calculator** and **Power of 5 Calculator**

Program that prints powers of 4 and 5 up to the number entered with Java loops.

## Combination

Program to calculate combination with Java.

The number of r-combinations from a given of n elements is often denoted in elementary combinatorics texts by C(n,r).

### Formula:

C(n,r) = n! / (r! * (n-r)!)

## Exponent

Program that calculates exponential numbers with values entered by the user in Java **(For Loop)**

## Armstrong Number

Java program determines whether the integer entered is a **Narcissistic / Armstrong number or not**.

In number theory, a narcissistic number (also known as a pluperfect digital invariant (an Armstrong number (after Michael F. Armstrong) or a plus perfect number) in a given number base b is a number that is the sum of its own digits each raised to the power of the number of digits.

## Sum Of Digits

Program to calculate the sum of digits of a number.

## Harmonic Series

In [mathematics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mathematics), the harmonic series is the [infinite series](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Series_(mathematics)) formed by summing all positive [unit fractions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unit_fraction):

**Java Program to Generate Harmonic Series**

## Print Diamond

Java program to print diamond star pattern. 

Using for loop.
