## Zodiac Animal Program

There are 12 zodiac signs and the order goes like this: Rat, Ox, Tiger, Rabbit, Dragon, Snake, Horse, Goat, Monkey, Rooster, Dog and Pig. The program find your Chinese zodiac animal in Java.

## Leap Years Program

To be a leap year, the year number must be divisible by four – except for end-of-century years, which must be divisible by 400.

## Password Control Program

Customer account login password control with **while** loop.

## Average

Program that calculates the average of numbers divisible by 3 and 4 from numbers 0 to the number entered with Java loops.

## Sum of even Numbers

A program that accepts input from the user until a single number is entered with Java loops and adds even and multiples of 4 from the entered values ​​and prints it on the screen.

## Exponent Calculator

**Power of 4 Calculator** and **Power of 5 Calculator**

Program that prints powers of 4 and 5 up to the number entered with Java loops.

## Combination

Program to calculate combination with Java.

The number of r-combinations from a given of n elements is often denoted in elementary combinatorics texts by C(n,r).

### Formula:

C(n,r) = n! / (r! * (n-r)!)

## Exponent

Program that calculates exponential numbers with values entered by the user in Java **(For Loop)**

## Armstrong Number

Java program determines whether the integer entered is a **Narcissistic / Armstrong number or not**.

In number theory, a narcissistic number (also known as a pluperfect digital invariant (an Armstrong number (after Michael F. Armstrong) or a plus perfect number) in a given number base b is a number that is the sum of its own digits each raised to the power of the number of digits.

## Sum Of Digits

Program to calculate the sum of digits of a number.

## Harmonic Series

In [mathematics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mathematics), the harmonic series is the [infinite series](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Series_(mathematics)) formed by summing all positive [unit fractions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unit_fraction):

**Java Program to Generate Harmonic Series**

## Print Diamond

Java program to print diamond star pattern. 

Using for loop.

## ATM Project

ATM Project Java.

In the ATM program, the user has to select an option from the options displayed on the screen. The options are related to withdraw the money, deposit the money, check the balance, and exit.

To withdraw the money, we simply get the withdrawal amount from the user and remove that amount from the total balance and print the successful message.

To deposit the money, we simply get the deposit amount from the user, add it to the total balance and print the successful message.

To check balance, we simply print the total balance of the user.

## Java Program to Find GCD and LCM

GCD or the Greatest Common Divisor of two given numbers A and B is the highest number dividing both A and B completely, i.e., leaving remainder 0 in each case. LCM or the Least Common Multiple of two given numbers A and B is the Least number which can be divided by both A and B, leaving remainder 0 in each case.

### Formula

LCM(A, B)  =  (a * b) / GCD(A, B)

## Finding MIN and MAX from given number in Java

Java program that finds the MAX and MIN numbers entered from user.

## Perfect Number

In number theory, a perfect number is a positive integer that is equal to the sum of its positive divisors, excluding the number itself.

For instance, 6 has divisors 1, 2 and 3 (excluding itself), and 1 + 2 + 3 = 6, so 6 is a perfect number. [More information](https://www.quantamagazine.org/the-mysterious-math-of-perfect-numbers-20210315/#:~:text=%E2%80%9CPerfect%20numbers%E2%80%9D%20are%20equal%20to,%2B%204%20%2B%202%20%2B%201.)

## Inverted Triangle

Inverted triangle in Java using loops.

## Prime Number

Prime Number Program in Java.

## Fibonacci Series

Fibonacci series in Java

In fibonacci series, next number is the sum of previous two numbers for example 0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55 etc. The first two numbers of fibonacci series are 0 and 1.
